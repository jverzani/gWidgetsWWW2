* <del>tkdensity examples -- are comboboxes broken? Seems they stop calling "change" handler...</del>


* <del>gtable:</del>
  - <del>paging is broken</del>
  - <del>Reassingment [<- does not allow shortening</del>

FastRWeb
--------

* work in tempfiles (gsvg say) and tmp url

* 


nginx
-----

* <done>load_app for loading many apps in startup script. See Rook.sh</del>

apache proxy
------------

* <del>give example of proxyPassReverse - not rApache</del>


Documentation
--------------

* roxygen docs

* vignette



Unit tests
----------

* add more

App
---

* session manager -- can we make session accessible to local user? can
  we make ability to broadcast if $listen is done?

* make load_app load an app, be it a script or a directory

* make load_dir load all apps in a directory -- if a script (*.R) or a
  directory. This way we can start server to run headless more simply

AJAX calls
----------

* put javascript into a namespace

* can replace run_transport with jRpc call 

* proxy calls: should make configuration of gtable view and gdf view
  user customizable. WOuld need to add user-defined methods

Widgets
--------

containers
----------

* gformlayout (mebbe)


gWidgets
---------

* gedit "validate.type" -- valid.type, rename

* gcombobox 

- cant get templates to work! Ughh. displayTpl is close,
  but no cigar

- would like remote queryMode for autocomplete on larger stores

- fonts -- do we need? Use HTML

* ggooglevis in a panel? XXX This needs work

* galert: no css, too wide. Why? (css missing)

* gcanvas: working, needs documenting

* gtable: 

- checkbox selection; grouping variables (add), means to limit
  which fields are shown

- --an't be bottom in layout???--

* --gdf: We can add and edit, but can't delete. WOuld like to use Rest proxy, but isn't working iwth Rook, as the request is denied -- not even parsable--

* work on size issues with radio, check box
