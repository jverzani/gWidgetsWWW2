## Extjs from http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/

OPEN SOURCE LICENSE

Sencha is an avid supporter of open source software. Our open source
license is the appropriate option if you are creating an open source
application under a license compatible with the GNU GPL license
v3. Although the GPLv3 has many terms, the most important is that you
must provide the source code of your application to your users so they
can be free to modify your application for their own needs.


This derived work (gWidgetsWWW2) does not include all files included with extjs, though those it
does include are not modified. This modification is covered under http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html where 4 criteria must be met:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

This is covered here and the date is in the DESCRIPTION file

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all
notices”.

The license.txt file contains the original license for the source.

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.


This derived work is released under the GPLv3 license.


d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.

Not applicable.
