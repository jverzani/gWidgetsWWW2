\description{
The convenience reference class method \code{clear} will clear the
text. This is basically the same as \code{svalue(obj) <- ""}.
}
\details{
We add in reference methods \code{show_loading} and
\code{hide_loading} to allow one to indicate something is
loading. Not really that useful though, as is. This is due to how
the JavaScript commands come back from the R process in a block so
unless the browser takes a long time to process the returning
JavaScript, you will likely show the loading for just a bit.

This class inherits for \code{GContainer}, thereby allowing one to
add in widgets in addition to the message by using the status bar
as the parent container. This might be useful.
